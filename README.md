## Overview

NUBILA-AI is a versatile bot designed to interact across multiple platforms, leveraging a robust architecture for data handling and reasoning. It's built with modularity in mind, allowing for easy extension and integration with new services. The bot processes user prompts, performs complex reasoning, and provides validated results through a multi-layered system. 

## Architecture

The NUBILA-AI bot is structured into three distinct layers:

1.  **Bot Layer:** This is the user-facing interface, responsible for receiving prompts from various platforms such as Discord, Telegram, and others. It manages the communication flow and delivers results back to the user. Think of it as the messenger for user interactions.

2.  **Reasoning Layer:** The core of the bot's logic. This layer takes the prompt from the Bot Layer and processes it. It uses multiple components, including a reasoning engine, a database, and external API calls. This layer is responsible for interpreting the user intent, accessing the relevant data, and generating actions, resulting in the execution of the prompt.

3.  **Data Layer:** The foundation of the bot, it is based around a validation network that collects data for future prompts. It houses a decentralized validation network, receiving data from various sources for processing, and ensuring the reliability and accuracy of the information used by the bot.
